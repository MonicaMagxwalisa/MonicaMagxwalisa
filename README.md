👋 Hi, My name ia Monica Magxwalisa from Saldanha Bay.
🌱 I’m currently learning software development at Codespace academy.
👀 I’m interested in using technology to promote environmental sustainability, I want to use my skills for environmental data analysis and 
    also learn how to build applications that help track and reduce carbon footprints.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that leverage software to solve environmental challenges, such as apps for recycling, conservation, and renewable energy promotion.
